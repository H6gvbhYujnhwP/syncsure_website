# SyncSure Deployment Trigger V2

This file triggers a new deployment to resolve caching issues and deploy the latest authentication fixes.

## Changes Made:
- Fixed login redirect to use React Router navigation instead of window.location.href
- Added authentication protection to Dashboard component
- Created DashboardLoginAuth test page for debugging
- Updated LoginFixed component to use proper navigation
- Added authentication state checking and loading states

## Deployment Timestamp:
2025-09-07 15:18:00 UTC

## Version:
Authentication Fix V2.0

## Expected Behavior After Deployment:
1. Login form should properly redirect to dashboard after successful authentication
2. Dashboard should redirect to login if user is not authenticated
3. Navigation should work smoothly without page reloads
4. Test page at /dashboard-login-auth should show authentication status

## Test URLs:
- /login - Login page
- /dashboard - Protected dashboard (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- /dashboard-login-auth - Test page for debugging authentication
