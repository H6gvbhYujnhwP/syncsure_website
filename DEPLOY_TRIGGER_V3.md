# SyncSure Frontend Deployment Trigger V3

## Changes Made
- Fixed SPA routing issue by adding proper fallback configuration to static.json
- Added `"routes": { "/**": "index.html" }` to ensure all routes serve the React app
- This fixes the "Not Found" error when refreshing pages like /dashboard, /login, etc.

## Deployment Required
This change requires a frontend redeployment to take effect.

## Expected Result
After deployment, refreshing any page (dashboard, login, etc.) should work correctly instead of showing "Not Found".
