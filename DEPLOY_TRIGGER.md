Reason: NUCLEAR OPTION - Replace entire Login component to bypass cache issues

DRASTIC MEASURES:
1. Created completely new LoginFixed.jsx component with direct implementation
2. Updated App.jsx to use LoginFixed instead of Login
3. Added extensive console logging with emojis for easy identification
4. Hardcoded API URL to bypass environment variable issues
5. Simplified form handling to eliminate any potential React state issues

BUILD STAMP: v2025.09.07.0925 - Nuclear Login Replacement

This should definitely work as it's a completely new component with zero dependencies on the old cached code.
