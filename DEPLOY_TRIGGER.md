This file is used to trigger frontend redeployments when needed.

Reason: CACHE-BUST - Force fresh deployment with environment variables

CRITICAL FIXES:
1. Added .env.production with VITE_API_BASE environment variable
2. Updated Login.jsx to use configurable API base URL
3. Removed onClick handler - keeping only onSubmit for clean event handling
4. Force cache-busting deployment to ensure latest code is deployed

BUILD STAMP: v2025.09.07.0915 - Environment Configuration Update
