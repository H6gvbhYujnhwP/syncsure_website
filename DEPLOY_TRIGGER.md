Reason: DEBUG - Add comprehensive logging to identify login failure point

Added debug console.log statements to identify exactly where the handleLogin function is failing:
1. "Login attempt:" - ✅ Working (we see this)
2. "Validation failed – missing fields" - Check if validation is failing
3. "Sending login request to:" - Check if fetch is reached
4. "Got response:" - Check if backend responds

Also added onClick={handleLogin} to button for defensive programming.
