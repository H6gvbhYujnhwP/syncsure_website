Reason: CRITICAL - Force redeploy to sync complete Login.jsx authentication system

The Login.jsx component has complete authentication code locally but the deployed version is missing the handleLogin function. This is causing the "Sign in" button to do nothing.

DEPLOYMENT ISSUE: Frontend deployment is not picking up the latest code from GitHub repository.
