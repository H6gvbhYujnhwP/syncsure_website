Reason: CACHE-BUSTING SOLUTION - Add static.json and force clean deployment

COMPREHENSIVE FIXES:
1. Added static.json with proper cache headers (HTML never cached, assets cached long-term)
2. Dashboard component exists and is functional - "Not Found" issue should be resolved
3. LoginFixed component with emoji logging ready for deployment
4. Environment variables configured for production API calls

BUILD STAMP: v2025.09.07.0930 - Cache-Busting + Dashboard Fix

NEXT STEPS FOR USER:
1. Manual Deploy with "Clear build cache" on Render
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+F5)
3. Look for new asset hashes (not index-CwAdsWqv.js)
4. Check for emoji logs in console (ðŸš€ LOGIN FIXED...)
5. Test login -> should redirect to functional dashboard
